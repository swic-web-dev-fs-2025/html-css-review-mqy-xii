          Minecraft Prom is a Bedrock Edition event hosted twice a year, on a
          world designed to resemble the community's hometown, where friends get
          together to indulge in fun activities. The event can be broken down
          into two main parts: <strong>prom court</strong> and
          <strong>the afterparty</strong>.

          <strong>Prom court</strong> is the main event where participants have
          the option to run for prom king, prom queen, or court jester. Within
          each group, participants will challenge each other in a variety of
          minigames to gauge who is most worthy of these royal titles. The
          minigames players compete in consist of: Connect 4, spleef,
          tic-tac-toe, and dodgeball for the finale. The winners are awarded
          diamonds, exclusive royal cosmetics, and a Discord role. Once the
          royal winners are crowned, the afterparty begins.

          <strong>The afterparty</strong> is where players can openly explore
          the map and participate in other activities. A crowd favorite activity
          is fishing, where you can catch custom fish and sell them for
          diamonds. Diamonds can be spent on loot boxes containing cosmetics
          such as hats, back blings, and plushies.

          Minecraft Prom was originally just a replica build of the high school
          with minigames, serving as an alternative or addition to the school's
          official prom and homecoming dances. Since the first event in April
          2022, development has continued and now consists of several scripts
          and dozens of models to amplify the experience. Even after graduation,
          Minecraft Prom still serves as an event to bring players a slice of
          their hometown, however far they may be now.
